        <p>
          Descendent-selectors are incredibly useful, but if it is written as to
          reflect the HTML structure, it will lead to code that is harder to
          maintain in the future.

      <section class="chapter-sub-section">
        <p>
          By adding class and id attributes to elements, class and ID selectors
          can be supplied for a CSS rule.
        </p>
        <p>An id attribute value may only be used once.</p>
        <p>
          It is a standard convention for classes and IDs comprising of multiple
          words to be strung together by using dashes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If multiple CSS rules apply to the same element, then technically they
          all apply (more later).

        <h3 class="chapter-sub-section-heading">Why use classes over IDs?</h3>
        <p>
          In the real world, using IDs often lead to more code refactoring, and
          bugs when the project develops further. This is mitigated by using
          classes over IDs, even if the CSS rule is only meant to be applied to
          a single element.

      <p>
        When multiple of the same style is applied to an element, the last one
        is taken (more later).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is an industry standard to represent a color using the hexidecimal
        model, or rgba if transparency (alpha) is desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not reasonable to memorize or know many colors, instead, using a
        color picker is standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        VSCode has a built-in color picker that can be accessed by typing any
        hexidecimal value (#fff, for example), and then clicking this
        hexidecimal value.
      </p>
      <p>
        VSCode's color picker provides different models for values, which can
        be cycled through by clicking the value at the top of the color
        picker.
      </p>
      <p>
        A short-hand property is a special property that can be used to define
        multiple properties in a single declaration.

      <h2 class="chapter-heading">Ch. 29 Styling Links</h2>
      <p>
        It is not good practice to only use the element-selector for styling
        links. Links have a few states, that can be selected in CSS by use of
        specific pseudo-class selectors.
      </p>
      <p>Link pseudo-classes are always written in a specific order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>:link</li>
        <li>:visited</li>
        <li>:hover</li>
        <li>:active</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It may be useful to think of the acronym LVHA.</p>

        <p>
          Inheritance does not conflict with other selectors, rather,
          inheritance works by applying styles to all child elements.

        <h3 class="chapter-sub-section-heading">Global Reset</h3>
        <p>
          Browsers add default styling to elements that may not be desirable, and an effecient way to remove some
          of this styling is to override it using the universal selector:
        </p>

        <code><pre>* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}</pre>
        </code>

        <p>
          Lists require spacing to show the numbering or bullets, so along with the global reset, margin should be added
          to the left side of them.
        </p>
      </article>

      <p class="chapter-sub-section">
        Use <code>margin-top</code> and <code>margin-bottom</code> to create vertical space. It is best practice to only
        use one of these styles.
      </p>
