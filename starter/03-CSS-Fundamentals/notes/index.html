      <h2>Ch 24. Styling Text</h2>
      <p>Serif means those short, spike-like edges of text.</p>
      <p>The style of an element affects the style of its child elements.</p>
      <p>
        The style 'text-align: center' positions the text at the center of
        parent element.
      </p>
      <p>The default font-size is 16px.</p>

      <h2>Ch. 25 Combining Selectors</h2>
      <p>
        A list of selectors can be supplied for a CSS rule (known as a
        'list-selector').
      </p>
      <p>
        A string of selectors, separated by white-space, can be supplied for a
        CSS rule (known as a 'descendent-selector').
      </p>

      <article>
        <h3>Descendent-Selectors</h3>
        <p>
          Descendent-selectors are incredibly useful, but if it is written as to
          reflect the HTML structure, it will lead to code that is harder to
          maintain in the future.

      <h2>Ch. 26 Class and ID Selectors</h2>
      <p>
        By adding class and id attributes to elements, class and ID selectors
        can be supplied for a CSS rule.
      </p>
      <p>An id attribute value may only be used once.</p>
      <p>
        It is a standard convention for classes and IDs comprising of multiple
        words to be strung together by using dashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If multiple CSS rules apply to the same element, then technically they
        all apply (more later).
      </p>
      <article>
        <h3>Why use classes over IDs?</h3>
        <p>
          In the real world, using IDs often lead to more code refactoring, and
          bugs when the project develops further. This is mitigated by using
          classes over IDs, even if the CSS rule is only meant to be applied to
          a single element.

        <h2>Ch. 27 Working with Colors</h2>
        <p>
          When multiple of the same style is applied to an element, the last one
          is taken (more later).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is an industry standard to represent a color using the hexidecimal
          model, or rgba if transparency (alpha) is desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not reasonable to memorize or know many colors, instead, using a
          color picker is standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          VSCode has a built-in color picker that can be accessed by typing any
          hexidecimal value (#fff, for example), and then clicking this
          hexidecimal value.
        </p>
        <p>
          VSCode's color picker provides different models for values, which can
          be cycled through by clicking the value at the top of the color
          picker.
        </p>
        <p>
          A short-hand property is a special property that can be used to define
          multiple properties in a single declaration.

        <h2>Ch. 29 Styling Links</h2>
        <p>
          It is not good practice to only use the element-selector for styling
          links. Links have a few states, that can be selected in CSS by use of
          specific pseudo-class selectors.
        </p>
        <p>Link pseudo-classes are always written in a specific order:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>:link</li>
          <li>:visited</li>
          <li>:hover</li>
          <li>:active</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It may be useful to think of the acronym LVHA.</p>

        <h2>Ch. 30 Using Chrome Dev Tools</h2>
        <p>
          Features within the Chrome Browser (and other browsers) that provide
          additional tools to help developers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whilst inspecting an element, all of the CSS rules that were applied
          to it are shown.
        </p>

        <p>Each CSS rule provides their source.</p>

        <p>
          The "User Agent Stylesheet" source is the default CSS for that element
          selector.
        </p>

        <p>
          The state of a link element can be 'forced' by ticking the
          corresponding pseudo-class.

        <h2>Ch. 31 CSS Theory #1: Conflicts Between Selectors</h2>
        <img src="img/conflicting_selectors_and_declarations.png" />
        <img src="img/resolving_conflicing_selectors.png" />
        <p>
          In VSCode, mousing over a CSS selector will show the "Selector
          Specificity".
        </p>
        <p>
          Selector Specificity indicates the priority of the selector, highest
          to lowest priority read from left to right.

        <h2>Ch. 32 CSS Theory #2: Inheritance and the Universal Selector</h2>
        <p>
          An inherited property is very easily overwritten by any rule which has
          a value for that same property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inheritance does not conflict with other selectors, rather,
          inheritance works by applying styles to all child elements.
        </p>
        <img src="img/how_inheritance_works.png" />
        <p>
          By contrast, the universal selector applies to every element, and thus
          can conflict with other selectors.
