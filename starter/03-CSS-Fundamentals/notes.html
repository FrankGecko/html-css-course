      <h2>Ch 24. Styling Text</h2>
      <p>Serif means those short, spike-like edges of text.</p>
      <p>The style of an element affects the style of its child elements.</p>
      <p>
        The style 'text-align: center' positions the text at the center of
        parent element.
      </p>
      <p>The default font-size is 16px.</p>

      <h2>Ch. 25 Combining Selectors</h2>
      <p>
        A list of selectors can be supplied for a CSS rule (known as a
        'list-selector').
      </p>
      <p>
        A string of selectors, separated by white-space, can be supplied for a
        CSS rule (known as a 'descendent-selector').
      </p>

        <h3>Descendent-Selectors</h3>
        <p>
          Descendent-selectors are incredibly useful, but if it is written as to
          reflect the HTML structure, it will lead to code that is harder to
          maintain in the future.

      <h2>Ch. 26 Class and ID Selectors</h2>
      <p>
        By adding class and id attributes to elements, class and ID selectors
        can be supplied for a CSS rule.
      </p>
      <p>An id attribute value may only be used once.</p>
      <p>
        It is a standard convention for classes and IDs comprising of multiple
        words to be strung together by using dashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If multiple CSS rules apply to the same element, then technically they
        all apply (more later).
      </p>

        <h3>Why use classes over IDs?</h3>
        <p>
          In the real world, using IDs often lead to more code refactoring, and
          bugs when the project develops further. This is mitigated by using
          classes over IDs, even if the CSS rule is only meant to be applied to
          a single element.
