    <h2>Ch. 11 - HTML Document Structure</h2>

    <h3>Non-optional Elements</h3>
    <p>
      Every HTML document must have a doctype, html, head, and body element.
    </p>

    <h3>doctype element</h3>
    <p>
      This tells the browser that the following should be processed with HTML5.
    </p>

    <h3>Head Element</h3>
    <p>The head element is meant for things that don't appear on the page.</p>

    <h3>Body Element</h3>
    <p>The body element is meant for things that appear on the page.</p>

    <h3>Indentation</h3>
    <p>
      It is standard to indent child elements for better readability, and has no
      meaning to the browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Ch. 12 - Text Elements</h2>

    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p>There are 6 heading elements, h1 to h6</p>
    <p>It is good practice for each page to have only one h1 element.</p>

    <h3>Bold Text</h3>
    <p>There are two ways to bold text</p>
    <p>
      One way is to use the b element, but should be avoided, and rather use the
      HTML5 strong element; the reason being that the b element provides no
      semantic meaning, whilst strong means that this content is important and
      must stand out on the page
    </p>

    <h3>Italicized Text</h3>
    <p>There are two ways to bold text</p>
    <p>
      One way is to use the i element, but should be avoided, and rather use the
      HTML5 em element; the reason being that the i element provides no semantic
      meaning, whilst em means that this content is emphasized
